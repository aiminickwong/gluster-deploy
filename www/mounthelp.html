	<h2>Mounting a Glusterfs Volume</h2>
	<p>
	A gluster volume can be mounted with several protocols, although not all at
	the same time!<br><br>
	The sections below provide examples for mounting volumes across;<br>
	<ul>
	<li>SMB</li>
	<li>NFS</li>
	<li>Native</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p ><b>SMB</b><br>
	The SMB protocol relies upon the Samba service being setup across the gluster nodes.
	Once samba has been installed and configured, the volume can be mounted from a Windows 
	or OSX machine using the following syntax.<br>&nbsp;
	<span class="cli"><br>
	&nbsp;net use &lt;drive_letter&gt; \\gluster-node-name\volume-name<br>
	&nbsp;eg.<br>
	&nbsp;net use y: \\glusternode\myvolume<br><br>
	</span>
	</p>
	<p><b>NFS</b><br>
	Gluster support NFS v3, and so mount options from a client must adhere to the general 
	v3 syntax rules appropriate for the Unix/Linux platform you're using.<br><br>
	For NFS, two examples are shown. One showing typical Linux mount syntax, and the other showing 
	the updates necessary to /etc/fstab to make the mount persistent across client reboots.<br>&nbsp;
	<span class="cli"><br>
	&nbsp;mount -t nfs -o vers=3,proto=tcp gluster-node-name:/volume-name &lt;mount-point&gt;<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;For /etc/fstab<br>
	&nbsp;gluster-node-name:/volume-name &lt;mount-point&gt; nfs defaults,proto=tcp,vers=3,_netdev 0 0<br>&nbsp;
	</span>
	</p>
	<p><b>Native</b><br>
	The most efficient way to access a glusterfs volume is through the glusterfs client. The client understand the
	topology of the cluster and provides load balancing and failover capabilties. <br>&nbsp;
	<span class="cli"><br>
	&nbsp;mount -t glusterfs -o backupvolfile-server=gluster-node2 gluster-node-name1:/volume-name \<br>
	<span class="indent">&lt;mount-point&gt;</span><br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;For /etc/fstab<br>
	&nbsp;gluster-node-name:/volume-name &lt;mount-point&gt; glusterfs defaults,_netdev 0 0<br>&nbsp;
	</span>
	</p>
