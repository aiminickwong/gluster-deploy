<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
	Once the glusterfs packages are installed, you need to configure the gluster environment
	before any volumes can be presented to 'clients'. This tools enables you to quickly setup a 
	gluster cluster, by moving through several configuration phases;</p>
	<p><li><b>Node discovery :</b> scan a subnet to identify candidate nodes to build a cluster from</li></p>
	<p><li><b>SSH keys :</b> push ssh keys out to the cluster nodes to enable remote scripts to be run</li></p>
	<p><li><b>Disk discovery :</b> select which disks on the nodes are to be used as gluster 'bricks'</li></p>
	<p><li><b>Brick definition :</b> execution of scripts across nodes to create bricks in a standard manner</li></p>
	<p><li><b>Volume creation :</b> create and optimise a volume for a specific use case</li></p>
	<p>
	Once this process is complete you will have a fully functioning gluster environment, with the first volume
	created and available for client connections.
