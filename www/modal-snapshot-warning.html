<h3>Snapshot Support</h3>

<p>Although the underlying nodes in the cluster can provide a snapshot capability,
 the version of gluster you have installed does not provide snapshots.Snapshots are available from 
 version <strong>3.6</strong> onwards.
</p>
<p>You can still choose to configure the bricks for snapshots now, to make the transition 
to a later gluster release that does support snapshots easier, by clicking '<strong>OK</strong>'.</p>
<p>Clicking on '<strong>Cancel</strong>' will return you to the brick definition page, allowing you to change 
your selection.
