Development Log
---------------
 
0.1 (Complete - 07 Oct 2013)
  - detect gluster nodes
  - create cluster
  - distribute ssh keys
  - detect candidate (unused) disks
  - format disks as bricks, and mount them

0.2 (Complete - 01 Nov 2013)
  - added optparse module for command line arguments. Added -n to bypass accesskey checking
  - client <-> server exchanges now all xml based
  - added globals module to share config across modules
  - added ability to create a volume (dist or repl only) after bricks are defined
  - some minor UI fixes
  - added "error" and mount help pages
  - theme related elements split of to a separate file (theme.css)

0.3 (Complete - 28 Nov 2013)
  - UI theme tweaks to make active and available elements more visible
  - webserver now multi-threaded
  - security - once started in a client, access to the tool from other clients is blocked
  - added a progress 'window' for long running tasks e.g. brick formatting and vol create for example
  - Enabling a snapshot enabled config is now based on a toggle switch (ALL underlying nodes must dm-thinp support for this to be shown)
  - by enabling snapshot you now get dm-thinp based logical volumes (old LV type used when snapshot is set to off)
  - foundation for btrfs bricks added(in prep for gluster 3.5 - nb. kernel version >3.6 and btrfstools need to be present on all nodes)
 
0.4 (complete 19 Dec 2013)
  - fix - tidy up issueCMD code to return tuple, simplifying calling code - DONE (f0239185)
  - add hadoop workload type based on parameters in the hadoop/glusterfs-cluster-install project on the forge - DONE (a75e60af1)
  - fix - disk list presented should be sorted by node, then device ID - DONE (33e6e30c)
  - add --config-file (-f) to bypass the scan to start with a predefined list of servers DONE (a75e60af1)
  - add --port(-p) to allow the admin to specifiy the web port for the UI - DONE (a75e60af1)
  - fix presentation of many nodes in keymgmt (separate header and data elements) - DONE (dea42349)
  - tidy login page (hide 'breadcrumb' bar, merge logo into login element) - DONE

0.5 (planned) 
  - fix presentation of disks in disk discovery for many disks (separate header and data elements)
  - add scrollbar calc to ensure scrollbar aligned to table sides, regardless of browser theme 
  - update findDevs to return text OR xml, change calling code accordingly
  - Add btrfs brick build code
  - flag thin provisioning and btrfs support options as experimental - hook in confirm dialog
  - add a confirm dialog (faded background, alert box type function)

0.6 (planned)
  - move the brick formatting into separate threads - one per brick to drive all the formatting concurrently. 
  - print option using javascript print of a config page - user can then print or save to pdf
  - review object structure - introduce cluster->nodes->volume->brick schema
  - update volCreate page to allow user to build >1 volume during the run


0.7 (planned)
  - update buildBrick to account for raid card to set appropriate offsets on pvcreate and mkfs.xfs commands
  - add tooltip code 
  - add tooltips to help explain some ambiguous elements of the UI

  
Items under consideration
  - add an exit button to terminate the UI before the wizard is complete
  - change the code to permit forward and back navigation within the steps
  - add the capability to update /etc/hosts on nodes (when DNS is not available/resolving)
  - change the webserver to use a self signed cert for http access
  - Review the ssh/pexpect code - can it be tidier?
  - add a disk wipe capability in the event bricks are reused (i.e. lv already exists - perhaps the 
    disk selection should also include defined disks, that are empty?)
