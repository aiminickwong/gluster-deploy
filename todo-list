  - update findDevs to return text OR xml, change calling code accordingly
  - Add btrfs brick build code

0.6 (planned)
  - review object structure - introduce cluster->nodes->volume->brick schema
  - update volCreate page to allow user to build >1 volume during the run


0.7 (planned)
  - update buildBrick to account for raid card to set appropriate offsets on pvcreate and mkfs.xfs commands
  - add tooltip code

Items under consideration
  - move the brick formatting into separate threads - one per brick to drive all the formatting concurrently. 
  - add an exit button to terminate the UI before the wizard is complete
  - change the webserver to use a self signed cert for http access
  - Review the ssh/pexpect code - can it be tidier?
  - add a disk wipe capability in the event bricks are reused (i.e. lv already exists - perhaps the 
    disk selection should also include defined disks, that are empty?)
