Development Log
---------------
 
0.1 (Complete - 07 Oct 2013)
  - detect gluster nodes
  - create cluster
  - distribute ssh keys
  - detect candidate (unused) disks
  - format disks as bricks, and mount them

0.2 (Complete - 01 Nov 2013)
  - added optparse module for command line arguments. Added -n to bypass accesskey checking
  - client <-> server exchanges now all xml based
  - added globals module to share config across modules
  - added ability to create a volume (dist or repl only) after bricks are defined
  - some minor UI fixes
  - added "error" and mount help pages
  - theme related elements split of to a separate file (theme.css)

0.3 (Complete - 28 Nov 2013)
  - UI theme tweaks to make active and available elements more visible
  - webserver now multi-threaded
  - security - once started in a client, access to the tool from other clients is blocked
  - added a progress 'window' for long running tasks e.g. brick formatting and vol create for example
  - Enabling a snapshot enabled config is now based on a toggle switch (ALL underlying nodes must dm-thinp support for this to be shown)
  - by enabling snapshot you now get dm-thinp based logical volumes (old LV type used when snapshot is set to off)
  - foundation for btrfs bricks added(in prep for gluster 3.5 - nb. kernel version >3.6 and btrfstools need to be present on all nodes)
 
0.4 (complete 19 Dec 2013)
  - fix - tidy up issueCMD code to return tuple, simplifying calling code - DONE (f0239185)
  - add hadoop workload type based on parameters in the hadoop/glusterfs-cluster-install project on the forge - DONE (a75e60af1)
  - fix - disk list presented should be sorted by node, then device ID - DONE (33e6e30c)
  - add --config-file (-f) to bypass the scan to start with a predefined list of servers DONE (a75e60af1)
  - add --port(-p) to allow the admin to specifiy the web port for the UI - DONE (a75e60af1)
  - fix presentation of many nodes in keymgmt (separate header and data elements) - DONE (dea42349)
  - tidy login page (hide 'breadcrumb' bar, merge logo into login element) - DONE

0.5 (complete 23/01/2014) 
  - fix: presentation of disks in disk discovery for many disks (separate header and data elements) - DONE (9a8da4cd)
  - fix: log file entry created in createCluster showing all nodes, not just the nodes to add - DONE (f2edf737)
  - update findDevs to return text OR xml, change calling code accordingly - DONE (2b5458ef)
  - update config file logic to include a pathname - DONE (cfe7aa13)
  - update to pass config file brick parms through to UI - DONE (cc091991)
  - fix: undodeploy fixed to account for system vg's being similar to the name used for gluster's vg - DONE (d67e1601)
  - Add btrfs brick build code to formatBrick.sh - DONE (224caba9)
  - flag thin provisioning and btrfs support options as experimental - hook in confirm dialog - DONE (9c7811f9)
  - add a confirm dialog (faded background, alert box type function) - DONE (b7e94d54)

0.51 (complete 24/01/2014)
  - some tidy up across the python code
    * web UI logic now in separate webservices module (more to do there, later)
    * tidied up module imports 
    * renamed globalvars module as 'config' to observe standard naming conventions

0.6 (complete 04/02/2014)
  - review object structure - introduce cluster->nodes->volume->brick schema - DONE (3dc0e0a5)
  - Support multiple disks from the same node DONE (b8f254a0)
    * a numberic suffix is added to mountpoint and lv names if a node provides 
      >1 disk for formatting
    * assumptions in undodeploy reduced. Now using vg,lv and pv information from
      the brick definitions - enabling support for multiple bricks from the 
      same node
  - move the brick formatting for each node into separate threads - reducing setup time.DONE (66aa2cab)
  - Update finddevs to gather os release information - DONE
  - add os version info to node objects - DONE
  - fix in finddevs to return raidcard type more accurately - DONE
  - added new icons for planned exit and help buttons - DONE
  - add toolbar for help and quit functions (will be disabled in this release) - DONE (4e1374f1)
  - fix: query thread getting disabled, before it could start during brick definition. Added a time delay to starting the query polling, after the build-brick code gets invoked


0.7 (pending)
  - updates summary information to be more friendly
  - sync'd the summary info in the UI finish page with the summary info in the CLI
  - updated the closing remarks on the final page to change if the user aborts the wizard early
  - implement the quit button (only active when tasks are not active)
  - Add a magic button to the vol create page to decide on the brick layout automagically

0.8 (planned)
  - add config page option to allow admin to get a summary of the config deployed - user can then save/pdf the page

0.9 (planned)
  - add a help button to the toolbar, for step related guidance reusing the modal interface
  - fix: add scrollbar calc to ensure scrollbar aligned to table sides, regardless of browser theme 

  
Items under consideration

  - update buildBrick to account for raid card to set appropriate offsets on pvcreate and mkfs.xfs commands
    -> Need access to different configurations to test integration with specific raid card cli's

  - change the code to permit forward and back navigation within the steps
    -> Would need code base to include 'undo' code

  - update volCreate page to allow user to build >1 volume during the run
    -> likely need a redesign of brick to volume UI

  - add the capability to update /etc/hosts on nodes (when DNS is not available/resolving) 
    -> Could be an additional section in the config file (deploy.cfg)

  - change the webserver to use a self signed cert for http access

  - add a disk wipe capability in the event bricks are reused (i.e. lv already exists - perhaps the 
    disk selection should also include defined disks, that are empty?)
    -> although these can be detected, it leaves the tool open to user error and data loss
