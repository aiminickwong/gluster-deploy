Items under consideration
  - move the brick formatting into separate threads - one per brick to drive all the formatting concurrently. 
  - add an exit button to terminate the UI before the wizard is complete
  - change the code to permit forward and back navigation within the steps
  - add the capability to update /etc/hosts on nodes (when DNS is not available/resolving)
  - change the webserver to use a self signed cert for http access
  - Review the ssh/pexpect code - can it be tidier?
  - add a disk wipe capability in the event bricks are reused (i.e. lv already exists - perhaps the 
    disk selection should also include defined disks, that are empty?)
