Futures

- Near term
  - add an option for lvm control to brick definition page (to be extended later for btrfs support)
  - detect whether the lvm supports dm-thinp - if so prefer this over standard lv
  - add a progress tracker, or message queue that can be queried by the web client code to track long running tasks

- Longer Term
  - change the webserver to use a self signed cert for http access
  - Review the ssh code - it's untidy and could do with a spring clean
